# Password Generator

# Purpose
This project is designed to create a pseudo-random password that meets security requirements input by the user.

# Parameters
Given an HTML and CSS foundation, this project required the password generator to be created in javascript. Upon a user clicking the generate password button, they should be prompted to designate, in order, the desired length of their password from 8-128 characters, and whether they desire uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols to be included in the password. The password should then be output to the webpage.

# Thought process
I started coding this by defining the possible characters that might go into a password. I defined each class of character into an array that I could index into. In the future, I might try to alter this by selecting my characters by numeric code from a charset.
